title: "MATH/COSC 3570: Introduction to Data Science"
---

This course introduces main aspects of doing a practical data science project, from importing data to deploying what is learned from data. We start with learning popular data science tools such as basic [R](https://www.r-project.org/) and [Python](https://www.python.org/) programming, [Git](https://git-scm.com/) and [GitHub](https://github.com/), and interactive documenting systems RMarkdown and Quarto. Then we learn data importing, data visualization and data wrangling using both R and Python. The second half of the course focuses on several basic simulation and machine learning methods, including Monte Carlo simulation, linear regression, K-nearest neighbors, logistic regression, principal component analysis, and K-means clustering. We learn R [tidyverse](https://www.tidyverse.org/) and [tidymodels](https://www.tidymodels.org/) packages. For Python, [Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/) and [Scikit-Learn](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/) libraries are introduced.\
