. . .

- Having taken MATH 5700 (Probability) and MATH 5710 (Stats Inference) or other math and statistics courses (Stats Computing, etc) is recommended.

## Textbook
::: columns
::: column
- [(**ISL**) *An Introduction to Statistical Learning, 2nd edition*](https://www.statlearning.com/), by James et al. Publisher: Springer. 
<!-- - The 5th edition is sufficient. -->

In the Preface, 

> *... for advanced undergraduates or master's students in Statistics or related quantitative fields,*

> *... concentrate more on the applications of the methods and less on the mathematical details.*

## Learning Management System ([D2L](https://d2l.mu.edu/d2l/home/544009))

```{r}
knitr::include_graphics("./images/01-syllabus/d2l_6250.png")
```

- Any new announcement will be posted in **News** in **Course Home**.
<!-- - **Content > Start Here: Course Information** includes syllabus and other useful information. -->
<!-- - Week modules (**Content > Week 1 to Week 15**) include course materials. -->
- Submit your homework **Assessments > Dropbox**.

- Go to <https://www.marquette.edu/remote-learning/d2l.php> to learn more about D2L.


## Grading Policy &#x2728;
- The grade is earned out of **1000 total points** distributed as follows:
  - **Homework: 500 pts**
  - **Class activity: 200 pts**
  - **Final project presentation and/or written report: 300 pts**
  
  <!-- - Midterm or Final Exam? -->
  <!-- - Attendance and class participation? -->

- `r emo::ji("x")` No extra credit projects/homework/exam to compensate for a poor grade. 

<!-- - Individual grade will **NOT** be curved. -->

<!-- - This is not a course that gives most of students grade A. Want to obtain a good grade? Study hard. No pain, no gain! &#x270D; &#x270D; -->


## Grade-Percentage Conversion

- Your final grade is based on your percentage of pts earned out of 1000 pts.
- $[x, y)$ means greater than or equal to $x$ and less than $y$.

```{r}
letter <- c("A", "A-", "B+", "B", "B-", "C+", "C", "F")
percentage <- c("[94, 100]", "[90, 94)", "[87, 90)", "[83, 87)", "[80, 83)",
                "[77, 80)", "[70, 77)", "[0, 70)")
grade_dist <- data.frame(Grade = letter, Percentage = percentage)
knitr::kable(grade_dist, longtable = TRUE, caption = "") |> kable_styling(position = "center", font_size = 40)
```

## Homework (500 pts)

<!-- - There are 4 homework sets. -->
- **Assessments > Dropbox** and upload your homework in **PDF** format.

- `r emo::ji("x")` **No make-up homework**.

- Due **Friday 11:59 PM ** (**Hard deadline and no late submission**).

- You have **at least one week** to finish your homework.

<!-- - Your homework grade is based on (1) the completeness and correctness of your PDF document and (2) your in-class presentation of homework questions. -->


## In-Class Activity (200 pts)

- There will be 3 to 4 in-class activities.

- Students will learn from each other by presenting and discussing the assigned topics.

- More details about the in-class activities will be released later.



## Final Project (300 pts)


- The final project includes two parts: written report and oral presentation?.

- [**You have to participate (in-person) in the final presentation in order to pass the course.**]{.green}

- More details about the project will be released later.

## Academic Integrity

This course expects all students to follow University and College statements on [academic integrity](https://bulletin.marquette.edu/undergrad/academicregulations/).

- **Honor Pledge and Honor Code**: *I recognize the importance of personal integrity in all aspects of life and work. I commit myself to truthfulness, honor, and responsibility, by which I earn the respect of others. I support the development of good character, and commit myself to uphold the highest standards of academic integrity as an important aspect of personal integrity. My commitment obliges me to conduct myself according to the Marquette University Honor Code*.

<!-- - `r emo::ji("x")` `r emo::ji("x")` `r emo::ji("x")` You know what I am talking about. Yes, **DO NOT CHEAT**. `r emo::ji("x")` `r emo::ji("x")` `r emo::ji("x")` -->


## Attendance and COVID-19
- It is **your** responsibility as a Marquette University student to protect the health and safety of our community in this course.
- Visit [What to do if you are exposed to COVID-19 or test positive](https://www.marquette.edu/coronavirus/what-to-do-if-you-are-exposed-or-test-positive.php) website for university guidelines on the best course of action. 
- Visit guidance on Spring 2024 [Class attendance, withdrawal, and grading](https://www.marquette.edu/central/registrar/faculty-staff/guidance-on-spring-2024-class-attendance-withdrawal-grading.php)
  + Students are responsible for contacting instructors prior to the missed class session to indicate absence and the need to make up classwork/assignments.  
  + Students requesting make up classwork/assignments are required to provide the COVID Cheq "stop sign" to confirm inability to attend class.
  

<!-- ## Comments and Questions from the Background Survey -->
<!-- `r emo::ji("question")` **... I hope to start with a refresher on basics of the math required in this subject.**   -->
<!-- `r emo::ji("point_right")` We will review probability, statistics, and matrix algebra before we need them. -->

<!-- <br> -->

<!-- `r emo::ji("question")` **... any way to receive assignments and projects with as much lead time as possible to allow for adequate planning would be most appreciated.**   -->
<!-- `r emo::ji("point_right")` You have at least one week to do your homework. I'll try to release assignments as early as possible. -->

<!-- <br> -->

<!-- `r emo::ji("question")` **I am hoping course material/lectures may be available online as well as in person.**   -->
<!-- `r emo::ji("point_right")` All course materials will be put on D2L. I am not planning to record lectures because of low watching rate and solving time-consuming technical issues during classes. -->


<!-- <br> -->

<!-- `r emo::ji("question")` **I like when topics such as these are related back to the real world.**   -->
<!-- `r emo::ji("point_right")` We will deal with some real data sets. But the data sets are much smaller and more organized than the real-world data. We focus on methodology, not data cleaning, tidying or wrangling. -->


<!-- ## Code {background-color="black"} -->

<!-- - Let try some `code` and see what `happened` -->

<!-- ```{r} -->
<!-- #| echo: true -->
