<li>It is easy to generate interactive web graphics using R without knowing JavaScript!</li>
<li>Above all of that, making simple interactive plots are a sure-fire way to impress your coworkers!</li>
<li>A word of caution: if the interactivity doesn’t add anything to your visualization, don’t do it.</li>

<li>How about this!</li>
<li>We can actually create a more informative Inteactive ggplot with more functionality!</li>
<li>You see here, if we put our cursor on any data point, the exact value of hwy and displ will be shown ot us.</li>
<li>Also, several useful funcitons are shown on the top of the plot.</li>
<li>We can download the plot.</li>
<li>We can zoom the plot.</li>
<li>We can drag the plot.</li>
<li>We can also select any data points we are interested and like to further investigate.</li>
<li>Notice that the interactive data table are automatically changed to show the selected data point information.</li>
<li>How cool is that!</li>

<li>To create a <strong>plotly</strong> object
<ul>
<li>directly initializing a <strong>plotly</strong> object with <code>plot_ly()</code>, <code>plot_geo()</code>, etc.</li>
<li>transforming a <strong>ggplot2</strong> object via <code>ggplotly()</code> into a <strong>plotly</strong> object</li>

<li>We can specify the bar color we like using color argument.</li>
<li>Note that we cannot simply use the name of color as we do in R plotting, but have to add the function I().</li>
<li>It is because when we call the plot_ly(), it actually translate the R code into Javascript, and for some reason, we need to add I() to make the code work.</li>
<li>If you like to change the border color of the bar, you can specify a color in the stroke argument.</li>
<li>Span controls the width of the border. # doesn’t produce black bars plot_ly(loans, x = ~homeownership, color = “black”)</li>

<li>We can also create a line plot. It is useful if you have some time series data.</li>
<li>Here I create a data called tx5, and I am trying see the trend of the median home price of the 5 cities in Texas.</li>
<li>First, we can create plotly object, assigning the x and y variables, which are date and median.</li>
<li>Then we can add the line plot, one linetype for one city.</li>

<li>If you think the syntax is hard and not intuitive, and you love using ggplot, well here is good news.</li>
<li>The function ggplotly() translate ggplot2 to plotly.</li>
<li>You just create your ggplot, save it as an object, and then plug the object into the ggplotly function.</li>
<li>Bang! your ggplot becomes interactive!</li>
<li>How cool is that! Very cool and convenient!</li>
<li>That’s one of the reasons why we learn ggplot!</li>
<li>But so far the translation is not 100 percent working.</li>
