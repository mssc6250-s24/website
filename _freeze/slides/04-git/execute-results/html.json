You as a human get to decide where to put these version points, so it's not every single letter you change, it's not every single piece of code you write. -->\n<!-- - But at some point, you feel like I have added something to this project that is meaningful or noteworthy, or I'm done today, and I'm going to leave things where it is. It's useful to leave a human readable message along with that commit that you make for that particular version. -->\n- Installation instruction.\n- furniture assembly guide\n:::\n\n\n\n## Why Need Version Control\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](images/04-git/phd_comics_vc.gif){fig-align='center' width=45%}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n\n::: notes\n<!-- - Why we might need version control?  -->\n- Think if you are not using version control, you very much can end up in a situation like this where you have a document you are working on, and you know we are humans feel like ok i'm almost done, I'm going to call this particular version I have final.doc.\n- But then you actually get some maybe revision comments from your advisor, and then that becomes final_rev2.doc. And you go back and forth lots of times. At the end, it's everything like final, final3, final10, final_last whatever, it just keeps going.\n- The thing is these file names are not really very informative because final or final revisions don't really say anything.\n- But if you really had tagged the changes you make between the final and the final 2, that could actually be informative if you actually have to go back to them.\n:::\n\n\n\n\n# {background-image=\"images/04-git/file_management_1.png\" background-size=\"80%\" background-position=\"50% 50%\"}\n\n\n# {background-image=\"images/04-git/file_management_2.png\" background-size=\"80%\" background-position=\"50% 50%\"}\n\n\n# {background-image=\"images/04-git/file_management_3.png\" background-size=\"80%\" background-position=\"50% 50%\"}\n\n# {background-image=\"images/04-git/file_management_4.png\" background-size=\"80%\" background-position=\"50% 50%\"}\n\n\n# {background-image=\"images/04-git/file_management_5.png\" background-size=\"80%\" background-position=\"50% 50%\"}\n\n\n# {background-image=\"images/04-git/file_management_6.png\" background-size=\"80%\" background-position=\"50% 50%\"}\n\n\n# {background-image=\"images/04-git/file_management_7.png\" background-size=\"80%\" background-position=\"50% 50%\"}\n\n\n# When you [commit]{.blue} a file or set of files, <br>Git will save some information automatically.\n\n\n\n## How We Use Git and GitHub\n- On GitHub, I create organization [**math3570-s24** and repos](https://github.com/math3570-s24).\n\n::: small\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![Source: Data Science in a Box Unit 1 - Deck 3](images/04-git/whole-game-02.png){fig-align='center' width=80%}\n:::\n:::\n\n:::\n\n::: notes\n- How are we going to use Git/GitHub in this class?\n- We have a course organization (**2023-spring-math-3570**) I created on GitHub.\n- Within the organization, there will be a bunch of repositories I created for you.\n- Think each repo as a project you will be working on.
