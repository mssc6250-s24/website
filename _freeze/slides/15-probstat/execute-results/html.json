OK.\n:::\n\n## Probability as Relative Frequency\n\n- The *probability* that some outcome of a process will be obtained is the **relative frequency** with which that outcome would be obtained if the process were repeated **a large number of times independently** under **similar conditions**.\n\n- Example:\n    + **toss a coin**: probability of getting heads 🪙\n    + **pick a ball (red/blue) in an urn**: probability of getting a red ball 🔴  🔵\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\" hash='15-probstat_cache/revealjs/toss-coin_56688769a96d5f4bc39ca64298f5cbda'}\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n      Frequency Relative_Frequency\nHeads         6                0.6\nTails         4                0.4\nTotal        10                1.0\n---------------------\n      Frequency Relative_Frequency\nHeads       535               0.54\nTails       465               0.47\nTotal      1000               1.00\n---------------------\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n\n::: notes\n- There are more than one way to define a probability, and one common way is to view probability as relative frequency. \n- And the definition is as follows.\n-  The *probability* that some outcome/event of a process/experiment will be obtained is the **relative frequency** with which that outcome would be obtained if the experiment were *repeated a large number of times* under *similar (identical theoretically) conditions*.\n- Mathematically, we actually require infinite number of repetitions and identical condition.\n- Here are examples whose probability can be interpreted as relative frequency.\n- Suppose we toss or flip a coin, we can ask what's the probability of getting heads.\n- Or if the experiment is picking a ball (red/blue) in an urn, we can ask what's the probability of getting heads.\n- Take tossing a coin as example. To get the probability of getting heads or least the approximate of it. We can toss the coin many times, and then count the number of times that heads shows up, and get the relative frequency. \n- So here, if I toss a coin 10 times, the relative frequency is 0.4, and so the probability of getting heads is approximately 0.4.\n- And if I toss a coin 1000 times instead, the approximate probability becomes 51.4%.\n:::\n\n\n## Issues of **Relative Frequency** {visibility=\"hidden\"}\n\n- 😕 How large of a number is large enough? \n\n. . .\n\n- 😕 Meaning of \"under similar conditions\"\n\n\n. . .\n\n- 😕 The relative frequency is reliable under identical conditions?\n\n\n. . .\n\n- 👉  We only obtain an approximation instead of exact value.\n\n. . .\n\n- 😂  How do you compute the probability that Chicago Cubs wins the World Series next year? \n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](https://media.giphy.com/media/EKURBxKKkw0uY/giphy.gif){fig-align='center' width=40%}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n::: notes\n- This relative frequency definition of probability actually has some issues.\n- How large of a number is large enough? is 100 large enough, 1000?

We may not be able to have similar conditions every time we toss a coin. (air flow, the way of tossing a coin)\n- The relative frequency is reliable under identical conditions? Maybe a very skilled person can toss a fair coin in a way that heads always shows up. In this case, is the relative frequency reliable?

We wanna know what is the probability of getting a red ball?\n- If each ball is equally likely to be chosen (picking at random), apparently, $Pr(red) = 0.4$.\n# draw a ball at random from bag_balls, a \n# vector of length 5 with value red/blue\n- The idea of **Monte Carlo Simulation:** is that We repeat the experiment (drawing a ball) a large number of times to obtain the relative frequency of red ball to approximate the probability of getting a red ball, which is exactly what we do for tossing a coin before.\n- The code is shown right here.\n- First we can use rep() function to generate the bag that has 2 red balls and 3 blue balls.\n- To draw a ball at random, we can use the function sample(). It produces one random outcome.\n- To do a Monte Carlo Simulation, we can use replicate() function, which allows us to repeat the same job number of times.\n- So here, I repeatedly draw a ball 10000 times.\n- Finally, we can check the frequency table or frequency distribution using table() function. \n- To get the relative frequency, just divided by the total number of repetitions.\n- You can see that the result of MC simulation approximates the true probability very well. \n:::\n\n\n## Random Seed `set.seed()`\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nbag_balls\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n[1] \"red\"  \"red\"  \"blue\" \"blue\" \"blue\"\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\n. . .\n\n- When doing sampling, we use **random number generators**, and results vary from sample to sample.\n\n. . .\n\n- To ensure the results are the same every time we do sampling, set the **random seed** to a specific number by `set.seed()`\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n## same result!\nset.seed(2024)\nsample(x = bag_balls, size = 3)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n[1] \"red\"  \"red\"  \"blue\"\n```\n:::\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nset.seed(2024)\nsample(bag_balls, 3)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n[1] \"red\"  \"red\"  \"blue\"\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\n::: notes\n- When we do sampling, we use random number generators in the computer language, and sampling results vary from sample to sample.

But be careful about the with and without replacement issue. \n- The default setting is draw without replacement. \n- So when we try to draw 6 balls at once, it renders an error, saying cannot take a sample larger than the population when 'replace = FALSE'. Basically we only 5 balls, without replacement, once a ball is drawn, the ball is out of bag, and only 4 balls remain in the bag. So without replacement, we can at most draw 5 balls, which is the entire population.\n- And if we wanna draw more than 5 times from the same bag, we got to specify  replace = TRUE. \n- And we can actually do the MC simulation using just the sample() function like sample(balls, size = B, replace = TRUE)\n- This means that we return the ball back to the bag after selecting it, and we repeatedly draw a ball continually B times basically under the same conditions.\n- Not surprisingly, we get results very similar to those previously obtained using replicate() function.\n:::\n\n\n## Normal (Gaussian) Distribution $N(\\mu, \\sigma^2)$\n\n- Density curve\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](images/15-probstat/nor-den-1.png){fig-align='center' width=68%}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n::: notes\n- Normal Distribution is also called Gaussian distribution.\n- It has two parameters that determine its density function and its density curve or distribution shape.\n- One is its mean $\\mu$, the other variance $\\sigma^2$.\n- It has a bell-shaped density curve symmetric about it mean.\n:::\n\n\n## Draw Random Values from $N(\\mu, \\sigma^2)$\n\n- `rnorm(n, mean, sd)`: Draw $n$ observations from a normal distribution with mean `mean` and standard deviation `sd`.\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n## the default mean = 0 and sd = 1 (standard normal)\nrnorm(5)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n[1] -1.189  0.438  0.017 -0.410  0.341\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\n. . .\n\n- $100$ random draws from $N(0, 1)$\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\" hash='15-probstat_cache/revealjs/nor-den-draw_18118755a12f8f70a15992cf93cb6109'}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](images/15-probstat/nor-den-draw-1.png){fig-align='center' width=50%}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n::: notes\n- We use `rnorm(n, mean, sd)` to draw n observations from the normal distribution with mean `mean` and standard deviation `sd`.\n- the default distribution is standard normal (mean is 0 and sd is 1)\n- So we can easily draw normal samples as many as we want.\n- All those red points are random draws from the standard normal. \n- You can see that most of the points are around the mean because the density around the mean is higher.\n- Also, we can see when we draw normal samples, it is very difficult to get a sample with a very extreme value because its corresponding density value is quite small.\n- Therefore, we tend to underestimate the population variance if we use the sample data to estimate it. And that's one of the reason why we divided by n - 1 in the sample variance formula to sort of correct this underestimation.\n:::\n\n\n## Histogram of Normal Data (n = 20)\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nnor_sample <- rnorm(20)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](images/15-probstat/unnamed-chunk-19-1.png){fig-align='center' width=75%}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n::: notes\n- We talked about this before.
