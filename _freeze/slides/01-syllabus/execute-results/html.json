I hope you have a great winter break. Welcome to 3570 Introduction to Data Science course. I am your instructor Cheng-Han Yu.  \n\n- First thing first. Get to know each other. Let me first introduce my self. I was born and grew up in Taipei, Taiwan, my home country, which is a island right next to China. Taipei is a big city in terms of population. It is about the same population size as Chicago. This building is called Taipei 101, which is the tallest building in Taiwan.\n:::\n\n## My Journey {background-image=\"images/01-syllabus/sample_gate.png\" background-size=\"cover\" background-position=\"50% 50%\" background-opacity=\"0.3\"}\n\n-   Assistant Professor (2020/08 - )\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](./images/01-syllabus/mu.svg){fig-align='center' width=20%}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n-   Postdoctoral Fellow\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](./images/01-syllabus/rice.png){fig-align='center' width=20%}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n-   PhD in Statistics\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](./images/01-syllabus/ucsc.png){fig-align='center' width=20%}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n-   MA in Economics/PhD program in Statistics\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](./images/01-syllabus/iub.png){fig-align='center' width=20%}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n\n::: notes\nAfter college, working and doing military service for several years, I came to the US for my PhD degree. Originally I would like to study economics, but then I switched my major to statistics. \n\n- I got my master degree in economics from Indiana University Bloomington, then I transferred to UC Santa Cruz to finish my PhD studies. \n- Then I spent two years doing my postdoctoral research at Rice University in Houston, Texas.\n- Finally, in fall 2020, I came to Marquette as an assistant professor.\n- Midwest/Indiana-West/California-South/Texas-Midwest/Wisconsin\n- Been to any one of these universities/cities? \n- The most beautiful campus.\n- Who are international students? I can totally understand how hard studying and living in another country. Feel free to share your stories or difficulties, and I am more than happy to help you if you have any questions.\n- Poor listening and speaking skills. I was shy. \n- OK so, this is my background. How about you introducing yourself as well. You can share anything, your major, hobbies, your favorite food, what do you want to do after graduation, anything, \n- I have the class list. I'd like to learn your face and remember your name. You know, you all wear a mask. It's hard to recognize you and connect your name and your face. \n- When I call your name, you can say something about yourself. No need to be long, couple of seconds are good.\n:::\n\n## How to Reach Me\n\n- Office hours **TuTh 4:50 - 5:50 PM** and **Fri 12 - 1 PM** in **Cudahy Hall 353**.\n- üìß  <cheng-han.yu@marquette.edu> \n  + Answer your question within 24 hours. \n  + Expect a reply on **Monday** if shoot me a message **on weekends**.\n  + Start your subject line with **[math3570]** or **[cosc3570]** followed by a **clear description of your question**. \n  \n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](./images/01-syllabus/3570_email.png){fig-align='center' width=45%}\n:::\n:::\n\n  + I will **NOT** reply your e-mail if ... **Check the email policy in the [syllabus](../syllabus/syllabus-3570-s23.pdf)**!\n\n\n## When You Have Two Dr. Yu in One Semester üòÇ\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](./images/01-syllabus/email_example_student.png){fig-align='center' width=100%}\n:::\n:::\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](./images/01-syllabus/email_example.png){fig-align='center' width=100%}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n:::\n- This is a real case happened last semester. A student of my class sent her homework of another class linear systems to me because the instructor of that course also has last name Yu, and she messed up. So if you remember to add course number in the subject line, it will greatly reduce the possibility of sending a wrong message. And it will save your time and my time, and so we all can work more efficiently. Right?\n:::\n\n\n## What is This Course?\n- **Every** *aspect of doing a practical data science project, from importing data to deploying what we learn from data*.\n \n \n. . .\n\n‚ùì **What are prerequisites?**  \nüëâ COSC 1010 (Intro Programming) and MATH 4720 (Intro Stats) or MATH 2780 (Intro Regression)\n\n<br>\n\n. . .\n\n‚ùì **Is this like another intro stats course?**  \nüëâ No. Statistics and data science are closely related.  \n\n. . .\n\nNowadays  \nüëâ Data science is a *broader* subject than statistics.  \n\n. . .\n\nüëâ Statistics focuses more on *analyzing and learning from data*, a part of the entire workflow of data science.\n\n\n<br>\n\n. . .\n\n\n‚ùì **Is this like another intro CS or programming course?**  \nüëâ Absolutely not. We learn how to **code for doing data science**, not for understanding computer systems and structures.\n\n::: notes\n- Of course we will not cover every detail form A to Z of DS in one semester becuase DS is such a huge subject, just like computer science. It's impossible to learn CS in one semester by just taking intro to CS, right? So we'll just learn the basic and essential concepts and tools used is DS.\n:::\n\n## What is NOT Covered in This Course\n\n- **Advanced data analytics and computing**\n  <!-- + MATH 4720 Statistical Methods -->\n  <!-- + MATH 4740 Biostatistical Methods -->\n  + MATH 4750 Statistical Computing\n  + MATH 4760 Time Series Analysis\n  + MATH 4780 Regression Analysis\n  + COSC 4600 Fundamentals of Artificial Intelligence\n  + COSC 4610 Data Mining\n  + COEN 4860 Introduction to Neural Networks\n\n. . .\n\n- **Big data**: We start with small, in-memory data sets. You don't know how to tackle big data unless you have experience with small data.\n\n. . .\n\n- **Database**: You'll learn SQL in \n  + COSC 4800 Principles of Database Systems\n  + INSY 4052 Database Management Systems.\n\n\n::: notes\n- We won't talk about topics like cloud computing, parallel computing, distributed computing.\n- **Big data techniques**: As a beginner, we focus on small, in-memory datasets. You can't tackle big data unless you have experience with small data.\n:::\n\n\n## What Computing Languages?\n\n\n::::: {.columns}\n\n:::: {.column width=\"50%\"}\n\n~ 70%\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](./images/01-syllabus/Rlogo.png){fig-align='center' width=50%}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n::::\n\n:::: {.column width=\"50%\"}\n\n~ 30%\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/c3/Python-logo-notext.svg){fig-align='center' width=45%}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n::::\n\n:::::\n\n- You've learned Python in COSC 1010.\n- Being R-Python bilingual is getting more and more important!\n\n. . .\n\nüëâ Wouldn't it be great to add both languages to your resume! üòé\n<!-- - [Why R](https://github.com/matloff/R-vs.-Python-for-Data-Science) -->\n\n. . .\n\n‚ùå If you do **NOT** want to learn **R**, do **NOT** take this course!

The University has mandated vaccination for all students for the academic year 2021-2022. COVID Cheq will still be used, but those fully vaccinated that provide documentation will no longer receive the daily symptom screening survey. Instead, they will receive a daily email providing a green check. You may be required to show your automated green check to show clearance for entry into campus buildings. If you are experiencing symptoms related to COVID-19, you must follow the link in the automated email to report symptoms. _\n\n- Visit [What to do if you are exposed to COVID-19 or test positive](https://www.marquette.edu/coronavirus/what-to-do-if-you-are-exposed-or-test-positive.php) website for university guidelines on the best course of action. \n\n- Visit guidance on Spring 2022 [Class attendance, withdrawal, and grading](https://www.marquette.edu/central/registrar/faculty-staff/guidance-on-fall-2021-class-attendance-withdrawal-grading.php)\n  + Students are responsible for contacting instructors **prior** to the missed class session to indicate absence and the need to make up classwork/assignments.  \n  + Students requesting make up classwork/assignments are required to provide the **COVID Cheq \"stop sign\"** to confirm inability to attend class.\n  \n\n## Q & A\n‚ùì **Will this course require any Textbook(s) or other materials to be purchased?**  \nüëâ No. All resources are free on line!\n\n\n<br>\n\n. . .\n\n‚ùì **Is it teaching the basics of data science?**  \nüëâ Yes, I think so.\n\n<br>\n\n. . .\n\n‚ùì **What do you think will be the most interesting part of the course?**  \nüëâ I love data visualization and web development.\n\n<br>\n\n. . .\n\n‚ùì **If this course is a joint label between COSC and MATH, is there a difference between any particular class section or other that we may have registered for?**  \nüëâ No difference. MATH 3570 and COSC 3570 are exactly the same course.\n\n\n<br>\n\n. . .\n\n‚ùì **What kind of time estimate do you believe most students should spend on reading + assignments for the course?**  \nüëâ Everyone is different. The more the better.\n\n\n\n## Q & A\n‚ùì **How accessible are you outside of class AND office hours?**  \nüëâ We can schedule a Teams/in-person meeting if you need.\n\n\n<br>\n\n. . .\n\n‚ùì **Will this class help me better understand how to code proficiently?**  \nüëâ As you learn to speak a foreign language, you need to code a lot, frequently and constantly in order to be proficient in any programming language. No shortcut.\n\n<br>\n\n. . .\n\n‚ùì **Do you know of any internships or research positions offered through Marquette University that incorporate the skills learned in this Data Science course?**  \nüëâ Quite many. Northwestern Mutual, Direct Supply, for example. I'll share intern info with you if I get any.\n\n. . .\n\n<br>\n\n\n‚ùì **Your question.**  \n\n# ü§ù Please read the syllabus!!!
