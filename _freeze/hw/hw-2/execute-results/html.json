However, you need to scan your paper and make it a PDF file.\n\n-   Your entire work on Statistical Computing and Data Analysis should be completed by any word processing software (Microsoft Word, Google Docs, [(R)Markdown](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/), [Quarto](https://quarto.org/), [LaTex](https://www.latex-project.org/), etc) and your preferred programming language. Your document should be a PDF file.\n\n-   Questions starting with **(MSSC)** are for MSSC 5780 students. MATH 4780 students could possibly earn extra points from them.\n\n-   It is your responsibility to let me understand what you try to show. If you type your answers, make sure there are no typos. I grade your work based on *what you show, not what you want to show*. If you choose to handwrite your answers, write them neatly. If I can't read your sloppy handwriting, your answer is judged as wrong.\n\n# Mathematical Derivation and Reasoning\n\nThe following questions are based on the population and sample linear regression model defined in our course slides and textbook.\n\n\n1. **(MSSC)** Find the least squares estimator $b_0$ and $b_1$ such that $$(b_0, b_1) = \\arg\\min_{\\beta_0, \\beta_1} \\sum_{i=1}^n(y_i - \\beta_0 - \\beta_1x_i)^2.$$\n\n<!-- 2. **(MSSC)** Show that $\\hat{y}_i = \\sum_{j=1}^n h_{ij}y_j$ where $h_{ij} = \\frac{1}{n} + \\frac{(x_i-\\overline{x})(x_j-\\overline{x})}{S_{xx}}$.  -->\n\n<!-- 1. The least squares approach chooses $b_0$ and $b_1$ to minimize the $SS_{res}$, i.e., $$(b_0, b_1) = \\arg\\min_{\\beta_0, \\beta_1} \\sum_{i=1}^n(y_i - \\beta_0 - \\beta_1x_i)^2.$$ Show that $$b_0 = \\overline{y} - b_1\\overline{x}$$ and $$b_1 = \\frac{\\sum_{i=1}^n(x_i-\\overline{x})(y_i - \\overline{y})}{\\sum_{i=1}^n(x_i - \\overline{x})^2} := \\frac{S_{xy}}{S_{xx}}.$$ -->\n\n2. **(MSSC)** Remember that before training sample is collected, $y_i$ are assumed random variables. Show that $b_0$ is an unbiased estimator for $\\beta_0$, i.e., $E(b_0) = \\beta_0$.\n\n3. **(MSSC)** Show that $\\sum_{i=1}^n(y_i - \\overline{y})^2 = \\sum_{i=1}^n(\\hat{y}_i - \\overline{y})^2 + \\sum_{i=1}^n(y_i - \\hat{y}_i)^2$, i.e., $SS_T = SS_R + SS_{res}$.\n\n<!-- 5.  **(MSSC)** Show that $SS_{res} = SS_T - b_1S_{xy}$, i.e., $SS_R = b_1S_{xy}$. This proof tells us that $SS_{res}$ is the variation with all variation explained by the association of $x$ and $y$ removed. -->\n\n<!-- 6.  **(MSSC)** Show that $E(MS_{res}) = \\sigma^2$ and $E(MS_R) = \\sigma^2 + \\beta_1^2S_{xx}$. [*Hint:* Use the fact that a $\\chi^2_{k}$ random variable has the mean value $k$.] This proof tells us that $MS_R$ is also an estimator for $\\sigma^2$. Although it is usually biased, it is unbiased when $\\beta_1 = 0$. Would $MS_R \\ge MS_{res}$ always hold? Why or why not? Please explain. -->\n\n# Statistical Computing and Data Analysis\n\nPlease perform a data analysis using $\\texttt{R}$ or your preferred language. **Any results should be generated by computer outputs, and your work should be done entirely by your computer**. **Handwriting is not allowed**. **Relevant code should be attached.**\n\n\n<!-- ## Simulation -->\n\n<!-- 1. Generate a simulated data of size $n = 100$ from the regression  -->\n\n<!-- $$y_i = 10 + 5x_i + \\epsilon_i, ~~ \\epsilon_i \\stackrel{iid}{\\sim} N(0, 2)$$ -->\n\n<!-- by completing the code -->\n\n<!-- ```{r} -->\n<!-- #| eval: false -->\n<!-- x <- runif(_____) -->\n<!-- y <- ____ + ____ * ____ + r____(_____, sd = _____) -->\n<!-- ``` -->\n\n\n<!-- Fit a simple linear regression model to the data, then check whether the true slope is captured by the 90% confidence interval for the slope. -->\n\n\n## Data Analysis\n\nThe data set [`mpg.csv`](./data/mpg.csv) presents data on the gasoline mileage performance of 32 different automobiles. (Table B.3 in the textbook LRA)\n\nTo import the data set into your R session, use `read.csv()` like\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ndata_name_you_like <- read.csv(\"the_path_that_saves_your_data/mpg.csv\")\n```\n:::\n\n\nOnce you load the data set, type its name on the R console. The data should be a data frame with 32 rows and 12 columns that looks like\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n      y  x1  x2  x3   x4   x5 x6 x7    x8   x9  x10 x11\n1 18.90 350 165 260 8.00 2.56  4  3 200.3 69.9 3910   1\n2 17.00 350 170 275 8.50 2.56  4  3 199.6 72.9 3860   1\n3 20.00 250 105 185 8.25 2.73  1  3 196.7 72.2 3510   1\n4 18.25 351 143 255 8.00 3.00  2  3 199.9 74.0 3890   1\n5 20.07 225  95 170 8.40 2.76  1  3 194.1 71.8 3365   0\n6 11.20 440 215 330 8.20 2.88  4  3 184.5 69.0 4215   1\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\nIf this is what you get, you are good to start! \n\nThe variables are\n\n:::: {.columns}\n\n::: {.column width=\"50%\"}\n\n- $y$: Miles per gallon\n- $x_1$: Displacement (cubic in.)\n- $x_2$: Horsepower (ft-lb)\n- $x_3$: Torque (ft-lb)\n- $x_4$: Compression ratio\n- $x_5$: Rear axle ratio\n:::\n\n::: {.column width=\"50%\"}\n\n- $x_6$: Carburetor (barrels)\n- $x_7$: No. of transmission speeds\n- $x_8$: Overall length (in.)\n- $x_9$: Width (in.)\n- $x_{10}$: Weight (lb)\n- $x_{11}$: Type of transmission (A automatic; M manual)\n:::\n\n::::\n\n1.  Fit a simple linear regression model relating gasoline mileage $y$ (miles per gallon) to engine displacement $x_1$ (cubic inches). Explain your coefficients. Any potential concern?\n\n2.  Provide the $95\\%$ CI for $\\beta_0$, $\\beta_1$ and $\\sigma^2$.\n\n3.  With $\\alpha = 0.05$, test if $\\beta_1$ is significantly different from 0. Provide procedure and steps, for example, $H_0$ and $H_1$, the test statistic or $p$-value, and decision rule.\n\n4.  Construct the ANOVA table and test for significance of regression.\n\n5.  What percent of the total variability in gasoline mileage is accounted for by the linear relationship with engine displacement?\n\n6.  Find a $95\\%$ CI on the mean gasoline mileage if the engine displacement is 275 in$^3$ engine.\n\n7.  Suppose that we wish to predict the gasoline mileage obtained from a car with a 275 in$^3$ engine. Give a point estimate of mileage. Find a 95% prediction interval (PI) on the mileage. Compare the PI with the CI in 6. Explain the difference between them. Which one is wider, and why?\n\n8.  Plot data $\\{(x_{1i}, y_i)\\}_{i=1}^{32}$, the fitted regression line, CI for $\\mu_{Y|X}$ and PI for $y$ in one figure. Add appropriate labels of axes, title, and legend. [*Hint:* Create a sequence of values of $x$, and obtain CI and PI for each value of $x$. Use `legend()` to add legends to a plot.]\n\n9.  Use the data and your fitted result to verify that\n    + (a) $\\scriptstyle \\sum_{i=1}^{32}(y_i - \\hat{y}_i) = \\sum_{i=1}^ne_i = 0$\n    + (b) $\\scriptstyle  \\sum_{i=1}^{32}y_i = \\sum_{i=1}^{32}\\hat{y}_i$\n    + (c) The LS regression line passes through the centroid $(\\overline{x}, \\overline{y})$\n    + (d) $\\scriptstyle \\sum_{i=1}^{32}x_ie_i = 0$\n    + (e) $\\scriptstyle  \\sum_{i=1}^{32}\\hat{y}_ie_i = 0$\n\n",
