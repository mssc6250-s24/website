## Format

<!-- On each class activity day, -->

<!-- -   [**Two assigned MSSC 5780**](activity-work.html) students are presenting the regression problems assigned two days before the presentation date. -->

<!-- -   Each presentation including Q & A is about <span style="color:blue"> **7 to 8 minute** </span> long. You will be forced to end your presentation if it is too long. -->

<!-- -   Each presenter should prepare *at least* **two non-Yes-No** questions for all participants to answer. -->

<!-- -   **Each of the [three assigned MATH 4780](activity-work.html)** students should ask either one or both presenters *at least one* **non-Yes-No** question. -->

## Presentation Materials

<!-- -   No specific presentation style/format/materials are required. You, the presenter, decide how you present your work. -->

<!-- -   The presenters should send the presentation materials, PDF, slides for example, to Dr. Yu *before* the class begins on the class activity day. -->

<!-- -   Your presentation materials will be posted on [Activity work](activity-work.html) page. -->

## Evaluation

<!-- There are 60 points for class participation in the final grade calculation. Dr. Yu is the only one who evaluates your participation. Your goal is to convince Dr. Yu that you understand your work well and get engaged in the class activity. -->
