## Date

There will be four in-class activities on **Thursdays on 2/15, 3/7, 4/11 and 5/2**.

## Format

On each class activity day, students are learning from each other through discussion.

-   The students will be randomly divided into **two** groups.

-   For each group, **two** students will be assigned as a discussion leader.

-   The assigned discussion leaders need to

    -   prepare the discussion materials
    -   present and teach the topic to the group
    -   prepare at least one learning activity for the topic (e.g. Q & A, little games, coding practice, etc)
    -   nominate **two** students that are mostly engaged

-   The group members need to

    -   learn the topic being discussed
    -   participate the learning activities designed by the leaders
    -   evaluate the leaders' performance

<!-- -   Each presenter should prepare *at least* **two non-Yes-No** questions for all participants to answer. -->

<!-- -   **Each of the [three assigned MATH 4780](activity-work.html)** students should ask either one or both presenters *at least one* **non-Yes-No** question. -->

-   The discussion is about **40 minutes** long, followed by a knowledge check.

## Discussion Materials

-   The leaders will get a discussion topic **as least one week** before the class activity.

-   No specific discussion or presentation style/format/materials are required. The leaders decide how they present their work, and lead the discussion.

-   The leaders should send their materials, PDF, slides for example, to Dr. Yu **before** the class begins on the class activity day.

-   Your discussion materials will be posted on [Activity work](activity-work.html) page.
