If some issues remain, explain why they cannot be fixed, and what is the limitation of your model due to these issues. Provide suggestions for improving your analysis.\nThe chosen data set cannot be any data set used in class, the textbook or homework assignments.\nBelow are a list of data repositories you may start with, but you are encouraged to explore more and find your favorite one.\n\nTidyTuesday\nKaggle\nAwesome Public Datasets\nHarvard Dataverse\nUCI Machine Learning Repository\nFiveThirtyEight\n\n\nIf you choose to do RM, your project should:\n\nExplain the model/method. Define and explain the notations, parameters, and model/method assumptions. Compare it with the model/method learned in class.\nShow the model/method with graphics and possible geometrical meaning. Compare it with the model/method learned in class.\nShow how to perform parameter estimation and response prediction. Discuss the methods used for training/fitting the model, and compare the prediction performance with MLR.\nInterpret the fitted and prediction results.\nDiscuss the advantages and disadvantages of the model/method. Under what situations the model/method performs the best/worst?\nDemonstrate how to fit the model and implement its relevant method/algorithm via a simulation study or data analysis.

Perform a thorough exploratory data analysis.\nAnalysis: Include the Regression Content by\n\nExplaining the chosen model/method.\nShowing why the chosen model(s) is appropriate and better than others.\nAnswering your research questions by the analysis result.\n\nConclusion: Restate your research question, and summarize how you learn from data to answer your questions. What is the contribution of this project? Discuss any limitation of your model/method, and how it could be improved for better inference or prediction results.\nReferences/Bibliography: Include a detailed list of references, including papers, books, websites, code, and any idea/work that is not produced by yourself.\n\nIf you choose to do RM, your report should include the following sections:\n\nIntroduction: State why you choose to learn this new method. Provide an overview and little history of the method. Describe the intuition and idea of the method. What are the pros and cons of the method?\nModel/Method: Provide the mathematical expression of the model. Address the points mentioned in Regression Content.\nSimulation: Do a simulation study, and compare the chosen method with other methods learned in class. Determine which method performs better under what conditions. Address the points mentioned in Regression Content.\nDiscussion: Based on the simulation results, discuss the advantages and disadvantages of the chosen method.

    "text": "Can I use a local install of R and RStudio instead of using the RStudio containers?\nThe short answer is, I‚Äôd rather you didn‚Äôt, to save yourself some headache. But, the long answer is, sure! But you will need to install a specific versions of R and RStudio for everything to work as expected. You will also need to install the R packages we‚Äôre using as well as have Git installed on your computer. These are not extremely challenging things to get right, but they are not trivial either, particularly on certain operating systems. Myself and the TAs are always happy to provide help with any computational questions when you‚Äôre working in the containers we have provided for you. If you‚Äôre working on your local setup, we can‚Äôt guarantee being able to resolve your issues, though we‚Äôre happy to try.\nIf you want to take this path, here is what you need to do:\n\nDownload and install R 4.1.2: https://cran.r-project.org/\nDownload and install a daily build of RStudio: https://dailies.rstudio.com/\nInstall Quarto CLI: https://quarto.org/docs/getting-started/installation.html\nInstall Git: https://happygitwithr.com/install-git.html\nInstall any necessary packages with install.packages(\"___\")\n\nAnd I‚Äôd like to reiterate again that successful installation of these software is not a learning goal of this course. So if any of this seems tedious or intimidating in any way, just use the computing environment we have set up for you. More on that here."

For example, 94.1 is in \\([93, 100]\\) and the grade is A and 92.8 is in \\([90, 94)\\) and the grade is A-.\n\n\n\n\nGrade-Percentage Conversion\n\n\nGrade\nPercentage\n\n\n\n\nA\n[94, 100]\n\n\nA-\n[90, 94)\n\n\nB+\n[87, 90)\n\n\nB\n[83, 87)\n\n\nB-\n[80, 83)\n\n\nC+\n[77, 80)\n\n\nC\n[70, 77)\n\n\nF\n[0, 70)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou may use any programming language to complete your homework and/or your project.\n\n\nHomework\n\n\nHomework will be assigned through the course website in weekly modules.\nTo submit your homework, please go to D2L > Assessments > Dropbox and upload your homework in PDF format.\nNo late or make-up homework for any reason.\n\n\n\nIn-Class Activity\n\nThere will be 3 to 4 in-class activities.\nStudents will learn from each other by presenting and discussing the assigned topics.\nMore details about the in-class activities will be released later.\n\n\n\nProject\n\nThe final project includes two parts: written report and oral presentation.\nYou need to participate (in-person) in the final presentation in order to pass the course.\nThe final project presentation is on Thursday, 5/9, 8 - 10 AM.\nMore details about the written report and oral presentation will be released later."

Under this heading you‚Äôll find an entry called Container Manager (CMGR Coursework Containers).\n\nIf the status shows something other than Operational, this means there is a known incident with the containers. Check back later to see if it‚Äôs been resolved. If there‚Äôs a deadline coming up soon, post on the course forum to let us know that there‚Äôs an issue. We can look into how quickly it might get resolved and decide on what to do about the deadline accordingly. Note: We don‚Äôt anticipate this to happen regularly, the systems are Operational a huge majority of the time!\nIf the status shows Operational, this means the system is expected to be working. Check your internet connection, if need be, restart your computer to ensure a fresh new connection. If your issue persists, post on the course forum with details on what you‚Äôve tried and the errors you see (including verbatim errors and/or screenshots).\nEither way you can also fill out the form here, which will notify our the R TA for the department as well as our undergraduate coordinator. They‚Äôll be able to help diagnose the issue."
