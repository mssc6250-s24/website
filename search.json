Thus, when we take into account the disease‚Äôs rarity and the relatively high false positive rate, it‚Äôs relatively unlikely that you actually have the disease. What a relief.\nsince disease status isn‚Äôt repeatable, the probability you have the disease is either 1 or 0 ‚Äì you have it or you don‚Äôt. To the contrary, medical testing (and data collection in general) is repeatable. You can get tested for the disease over and over and over. Thus, a frequentist analysis would ask: If I don‚Äôt actually have the disease, what‚Äôs the chance that I would‚Äôve tested positive? Since only 9 of the 96 people without the disease tested positive, there‚Äôs a roughly 10% (9/96) chance that you would‚Äôve tested positive even if you didn‚Äôt have the disease."

    "text": "Interpretation of LDA\n\nESL Fig 4.9Check ESL\nFind the linear combination \\(Z = a'X\\) such that the between class variance is maximized relative to the within-class variance.\nAgain, the between class variance is the variance of the class means of Z, and the within class variance is the pooled variance about the means. Figure 4.9 shows why this criterion makes sense. Although the direction joining the centroids separates the means as much as possible (i.e., maximizes the between-class variance), there is considerable overlap between the projected classes due to the nature of the covariances. By taking the covariance into account as well, a direction with minimum overlap can be found.\nGaussian classification with common covariances leads to linear decision boundaries. Classification can be achieved by sphering the data with respect to W, and classifying to the closest centroid (modulo log œÄk) in the sphered space. Since only the relative distances to the centroids count, one can confine the data to the subspace spanned by the centroids in the sphered space. This subspace can be further decomposed into successively optimal subspaces in term of centroid separation. This decomposition is identical to the decomposition due to Fisher."

This is not preferred in some practical situations such as genetic studies because expressions of genes from the same pathway may have large correlation, but biologist want to identify all of them instead of just one. The Ridge penalty may help in this case because it naturally considers the correlation structure. The following simulation may show the effect. - The Lasso problem is convex, although it may not be strictly convex in Œ≤ when p is large - The solution is a global minimum, but may not be the unique global one - The Lasso solution is unique under conditions of the covariance matrix\n\n\n\nmssc6250-s24.github.io/website"

Where a limitation of liability is not allowed in full or in part, this limitation may not apply to You.\nThe disclaimer of warranties and limitation of liability provided above shall be interpreted in a manner that, to the extent possible, most closely approximates an absolute disclaimer and waiver of all liability.\n\n\n\nSection 6 ‚Äì Term and Termination.\n\nThis Public License applies for the term of the Copyright and Similar Rights licensed here. However, if You fail to comply with this Public License, then Your rights under this Public License terminate automatically.\nWhere Your right to use the Licensed Material has terminated under Section 6(a), it reinstates:\n\nautomatically as of the date the violation is cured, provided it is cured within 30 days of Your discovery of the violation; or\nupon express reinstatement by the Licensor.\n\nFor the avoidance of doubt, this Section 6(b) does not affect any right the Licensor may have to seek remedies for Your violations of this Public License.\nFor the avoidance of doubt, the Licensor may also offer the Licensed Material under separate terms or conditions or stop distributing the Licensed Material at any time; however, doing so will not terminate this Public License.\nSections 1, 5, 6, 7, and 8 survive termination of this Public License.\n\n\n\nSection 7 ‚Äì Other Terms and Conditions.\n\nThe Licensor shall not be bound by any additional or different terms or conditions communicated by You unless expressly agreed.\nAny arrangements, understandings, or agreements regarding the Licensed Material not stated herein are separate from and independent of the terms and conditions of this Public License.\n\n\n\nSection 8 ‚Äì Interpretation.\n\nFor the avoidance of doubt, this Public License does not, and shall not be interpreted to, reduce, limit, restrict, or impose conditions on any use of the Licensed Material that could lawfully be made without permission under this Public License.\nTo the extent possible, if any provision of this Public License is deemed unenforceable, it shall be automatically reformed to the minimum extent necessary to make it enforceable.

Because the PCs after the first 2 PCs usually explain quite small variation in the data, and some of them may be just noises.\nLet‚Äôs see if we can interpret these PCs.\nFirst keep in mind that PCs are less interpretable than original features. Sometimes we even don‚Äôt know how to interpret it, especially for PCs that explain small variations. So this is the price we pay for dimension reduction.\nBut let‚Äôs look at this example.\nThe first loading vector places approximately equal weight on Assualt, Murder and Rape, with much less weights on UrbanPop.\nSo PC1 roughly corresponds to a overall serious crime rate because PC1 explains the variations of data caused by those crime variables Assualt, Murder and Rape.\nOn the contrary, the second loading vector places most of its weight on UrbanPop, and much less weight on the other 3 features.\nSo we can say PC2 roughly corresponds to the level of urbanization.\nSo you get the idea, Assualt, Murder and Rape are similar each other because they all are measures of crime rate.\nSo when reducing dimensions, we sort of combine the three similar variables together to become a one single index that measures an overall crime rate.\nUrban population measures a totally different thing. So the variation created by this variable cannot be explained well by the crime rate, and it should be absorbed in PC2."

    "text": "Cross Validation\n\nCross Validation (CV) is a resampling method.\nResampling methods refit a model of interest to data sampled from the training set.\n\nCV can be used to\n\nestimate the test error when there is no test data. (Model assessment)\n\nselect the tuning parameters that controls the model complexity/flexibility. (Model selection)\n\n\n\n\nHence, by adding this to the OLS objective function, the solution is more stable, in the sense that each time we observe a new set of data, this contour looks pretty much the same. This may be interpreted in several different ways such as: 1) the objective function is more convex and less affected by the random samples; 2) the variance of the estimator is smaller because the eigenvalues of \\(\\mathbf{X}^\\text{T}\\mathbf{X}+ n \\lambda \\mathbf{I}\\) are large."
